### About Me

<a>I'm a 15-year-old student in Turkey with a love to develop games, being mainly indie ones.</a>
<a>Game Maker Language is the most I know, with some others coming second.</a>
<a>I mostly do Undertale fan games as a hobby of mine, but I plan to turn it all into a career in the future.</a>
<a>Some of my examples of work include my take on Japaritale and possibly some original yet scrapped games.</a></a>
